What is the point to all of this??
I've always had an interest in different things, and having a local test has helped with learning.
It also has become apparent that I've needed to have a test bed for services as sometimes "testing" (ie. breaking) services like plex earns me glares from my family when it breaks.

But what about the cloud?!
Most of my stuff I have bought on sale / discount, and after a while the costs of cloud is just too steep.
